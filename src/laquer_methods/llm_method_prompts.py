It\u2019s up to chemistry teachers to remind us that there\u2019s far more to it than that. Chemicals are everywhere: They form the building blocks of matter that make up everything in the universe, including our bodies and every part of the environment we occupy.\nChemistry teachers help their students understand the structure and scientific properties of matter. If you have a real passion for chemistry, a career as a chemistry teacher can be yours if you\u2019re willing to commit the necessary time and effort.\nThis guide will help get you started on that path. You\u2019ll learn about the prerequisite education, likely income, and advantages and disadvantages of a career as a chemistry teacher. Browse through the article or use the following links to skip forward to what you\u2019re looking for:\n|High school chemistry teacher||Community college chemistry teacher||Four-year college/university chemistry professor|\n|Minimum education||Bachelor\u2019s degree; master\u2019s preferred||Master\u2019s degree; doctorate preferred||Doctorate|\n|Estimated annual income|| $57,200 (BLS) |\n$52,450 ( Glassdoor.com )\n$58,530 ( Neuvoo.com )\n$44,200 ( SalaryGenius.com )\n| $75,060 (BLS) |\n$47,552 ( PayScale.com )\n$65,840 (Houston Chronicle)\n$58,413 ( Salary.com )\n| $86,070 (BLS) |\n$81,460 (Houston Chronicle)\n$95,814 ( Salary.com )\nChemistry teachers instruct their students on the composition, structure and properties of matter. They show students the right ways to examine how materials interact \u2014 with each other and with energy.\nThe day-to-day responsibilities of chemistry teachers include lesson plan content, classroom management and grading student performance. They may also spend time outside of class answering student questions and providing one-on-one guidance.\nChemistry teachers work in high schools, community colleges and universities. Some work online in distance-learning programs.\nAt the university level, chemistry teachers are called professors. In addition to teaching, chemistry professors conduct research and scientific experiments in a laboratory, and review and analyze data from other labs. They publish their research findings in books and scientific journals.\nFull-time chemistry teachers from high school through the university level typically enjoy paid holidays and vacations in addition to retirement benefits and health insurance. Part-time and adjunct teachers, by contrast, often earn less pay and get few benefits.\nSomeone who is:\n- Analytical and curious by nature\n- Serious and studious in temperament\n- Interested in understanding the basic building blocks of the physical world\n- Dedicated to the scientific method\n- Patient and resourceful\n- Good at motivating and inspiring students\n- Organized and careful about time management\n- Devoted to learning\n- Service-oriented\n- Able to express ideas precisely in writing and in oral presentations\n- Highly knowledgeable about chemistry\n- Qualified with an advanced degree in chemistry or a field related to education\nCheck out this video as you think more about becoming a chemistry teacher.\nThere are many kinds of chemistry teachers. Throughout this guide, we\u2019re focusing on three main subtypes within this career: chemistry teachers in high schools, chemistry instructors in community colleges, and chemistry professors at universities and four-year colleges.\nThese teachers educate teens at public and private high schools.\nChemistry teachers who work at local or regional community colleges are sometimes called instructors.\nChemistry professors teach courses, conduct research and publish academic papers and books.\nIf you are serious about becoming a chemistry teacher, start thinking about how to improve your career prospects and develop your skills and connections. Consider seeking out a teaching internship or research fellowship in chemistry at the undergraduate or graduate level. Getting real-world experience in a chemistry lab or classroom will be invaluable for helping you get a job in the future.\nYou should also consider getting involved in one of the many chemistry-focused research and professional organizations including:\nThese groups will keep you up-to-date on the latest advances in chemistry and give you access to networking opportunities.\nIf you plan to pursue a career in academia, your ultimate goal will be to obtain tenure as a chemistry professor. The publishing requirements for tenure are exacting, with most prestigious journals accepting only 10 percent of papers submitted. This means you need a strong passion and commitment to original research. If successful, you may also advance to department head, which would mean performing more administrative duties and/or relaying the concerns of the Chemistry Department to the university at large.\nTo become a chemistry teacher at any level, you should seriously consider pursuing a master\u2019s degree or a doctorate. While you may be able to find a job teaching high school chemistry without an advanced degree, many jobs in chemistry education and research require a higher degree.",
        "https://work.chron.com/kind-degree-need-chemistry-teacher-6396.html": "By\nChron Contributor\nUpdated September 04, 2020\nThe American Chemical Society reports that high school science teachers are in demand, particularly those who can teach chemistry and physics. Secondary school chemistry teachers need a minimum of a bachelor's degree, and those who teach in public schools must fulfill additional state requirements, which may mean graduate credits or a master's degree. Chemistry teachers need graduate degrees to teach at the college level.\nThe basic requirement for high school chemistry teachers is a bachelor's degree in chemistry. As explained on the employment website ZipRecruiter , a state-issued teaching certificate is mandatory to teach in the public schools. Requirements vary by state so it's important to check with an academic advisor to be sure you're taking all the necessary courses.\nSample courses for a chemistry degree include biology, physics, calculus, general chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry and chemistry labs. In addition, teacher preparation includes classes in psychology, instructional techniques and methods of dealing with students. Prospective teachers must complete supervised practice teaching and pass state examinations. For chemistry teachers, these typically include a general test for all teachers plus a chemistry certification exam.\nMany chemistry teachers also have master's degrees in education or chemistry. Some states require teachers to complete a master's degree as part of the final certification process. In addition, alternative certification programs often award master's degrees. In these programs, students who already have bachelor's degrees take education classes and do supervised student teaching to become certified. Alternately, bachelor's degree graduates can qualify to teach in two-year colleges and technical schools by completely a master's in chemistry.\nMost four-year colleges and universities require teachers to have a doctorate in the field they teach, although sometimes part-time jobs go to those with master's degrees. A Ph.D. degree in chemistry usually takes six years beyond the bachelor's degree and includes both supervised research and specialized coursework.\nThe employment website PayScale reports that chemistry teachers earned an average of $50,017 per year as of 2020, with typical salaries ranging between $36,000 and $77,000 . Pay varies state to state and even among school districts within a state. Other factors affecting salary include level of education and number of years in the teaching profession.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), jobs for high school teachers overall will grow by 4 percent through 2029, a rate considered average when compared to other jobs.. Chemistry teachers, however, will have better prospects than most because of the scarcity of qualified applicants.\nFor post-secondary teachers, the BLS predicts a 9 percent job growth rate through 2029, which is much faster than average growth. As is the case with high school jobs, those qualified to teach chemistry may have even more opportunities than teachers of other subjects. According to the BLS, the 2019 median pay for postsecondary teachers was $79,540 . Median salary means that half in the profession earned more, while half earned less.\nReferences\nResources"

Nonetheless, human rights did not in fact exist until the end of the second World War, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted. Before, documents mentioned the \u201crights of man\u201d, \u201cfreedoms\u201d or simply, \u201crights\u201d. The question is, how did human rights come to mean what they do today? Many important documents on human rights exist from different countries and cultures, but 22 will be explained in this brief history on the topic.\n539 BC The Cyrus Cylinder\nIn 539 BC, Cyrus the Great conquered the city of Babylon, freed slaves to return home, and declared that people should have a choice in their religion. This event is considered by many to be the world\u2019s first charter of human rights in history . Prior to this, people had rights based on membership to a group, such as a family for example. This event served as an inspiration to the civilizations of India, Greece, and Rome, cultures that are known these days for their contributions to rights and freedoms.\n1215 The Magna Carta\nUndoubtedly a great first step in the long journey for human rights, a document like this would not come to be for another thousand years. Then in 1215, the Magna Carta, translated from Latin to mean \u201cThe Great Charter\u201d was issued by King John of England . This document, too, was a big step for rights because it established that the king was in fact subject to the law, despite a long history of actions without consequences. This was written a long time ago, when monarchies were commonplace, so is it still relevant? Many clauses are no longer applicable to modern times, however, the charter still holds timeless fundamental values such as the right to justice and a fair trial.\n1628 The Petition of Rights\nYet again, progress is made, but another 400 years goes by with little focus on establishing rights for the people. In 1628, the Petition of Right set out the rights and liberties of commoners, as opposed to the British Crown. English Parliament demanded no taxation without Parliament\u2019s consent, no imprisonment without a reason, no quartering soldiers, and no martial law in peacetime. The demands expounded upon the Magna Carta and some may sound familiar to people who are familiar with the US Bill of Rights. The next major document would not be written for another hundred years, sparked by the American Revolution.\n1776 The United States Declaration of Independence\nIn 1776, Thomas Jefferson and other prominent US political figures wrote the US Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as well as announced the colonies\u2019 separation from Great Britain. Adopted by Congress, the declaration is based on the statement \u201call men are created equal\u201d. Although not legally binding, the document would come to inspire many great future human rights documents. To think of the progress made between the Petition of Right and the US Declaration is truly astounding. The success of the Declaration of Independence led the United States of America to write a document that would eventually form a government and set laws in place, the Constitution of the United States of America.",
        "https://www.amnesty.nl/a-brief-history-of-human-rights": "The history of human rights is actually a combination of various histories.\n\u25cf Human rights in philosophy: the ideas on human dignity and the rights that belong to everyone everywhere.\n\u25cf Human rights in law: the norms and sanctions that over the centuries have been laid down in (international) law, treaties and declarations.\n\u25cf Human rights in politics and campaigning: the practice of denouncing abuses of governments and calling for solidarity and action for the victims.\nAre human rights as old as human civilization?\nSome human rights ideas are as old as civilization. From the earliest times, for example byb King Hammurabi of Babylon around 1750 BC, laws have been written (or cut in stone) that include principles of justice, fairness and protection. Such laws prescribed that:\n\u25cf people must be protected by law;\n\u25cf a ruler is restricted by law and cannot arbitrarily deal with his subjects;\n\u25cf women, children, foreigners and other groups deserve special protection;\n\u25cf even slaves should not be mistreated;\n\u25cf courts must be free from corruption and arbitrariness.\nThese ancient laws however cannot be equated to \u2018human rights\u2019. They were not universal: they were valid for a certain state or society, not for humanity as a whole. They maintained gross inequality: there was no question that a monarch, a citizen and a slave would have the same rights. And much of what we now label human rights is not mentioned in those old laws, such as the right to freedom of opinion or the prohibition of torture.\nA timeline\nIn the history of human rights, there is no linear sequence of developments. Yet a series of phases can be distinguished. \u2018Phase\u2019 here means that certain ideas and practices had a breakthrough or blossoming in a particular historical time. Not that they were always completely new at the time \u2013 see for example the reemergence of people\u2019s representation in Medieval times.\n- Ancient history: The inherent dignity of human beings. Ideas about the inherent dignity of man originated thousands of years ago, in law and religion. It came with notions such as that one should not use arbitrary violence, lie, steal or break contracts. Already before 200 BC. most of the world\u2019s major belief systems had been founded: the Jewish faith (later developed into Christianity), Confucianism and Daoism in China, Hinduism and Buddhism in India, and the humanistic philosophy of Athens.\n- 3th century BC: Equality. The idea that equality of rights applies to all people is found in the Greek philosophy of the Stoics. They considered man and woman to be equal. They argued for respect for women and children, for compassion and tolerance towards the other, for inclusion of \u2018barbarians\u2019 into the human community. Some stoics considered slaves on equal footing as well.\n- 13th century: People\u2019s representation. The practice that government owes a responsibility to representatives of the people already existed in Greek city states such as Athens, but thereafter disappeared for many centuries. From the 12th century, small parliaments were established in Scotland, Poland, the kingdom of Le\u00f3n and Paris. Most conspicuous was the English Magna Carta of 1215, a contract between the monarch and the (well-to-do) citizens who formed a \u2018parlamentium\u2019 (\u2018talkhouse\u2019).\n- 18th century: The right to individual freedom. Some protagonists are identified in the next paragraph. This was the era in which the American Declaration of Independence (1776) and the French Declaration of Human Rights and Citizen (1789) were adopted.\n- 19th century: Socio-economic rights and abolition of slavery. Rights to protection in the field of work and unemployment arose in the 19th century under pressure from the trade union movement. A British national trade union was founded in 1830. Under pressure from within and outside of parliament, the British Empire abolished the slave trade in 1807 and slavery in 1833. Only decades later was slavery abolished in countries such as Russia (1861), the Netherlands (1863) and the United States (1865).\n- Early 20th century: Equal rights for women and men. Women\u2019s suffrage was introduced in New Zealand (1893), later in countries including The Netherlands and Russia (1917), the United States (1920) and the United Kingdom (1928).\n- Since 1948: Universal standards. From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) has emerged an ongoing series of international human rights conventions, declarations and monitoring institutions.\nFive protagonists of individual freedom\nMany philosophers, activists, politicians and others have contributed to the development of human rights.",

        "https://psnet.ahrq.gov/perspective/artificial-intelligence-and-diagnostic-errors": "January 31, 2020\nThe definition of artificial intelligence (AI) used in healthcare, is broad with no true consensus among experts. However, as a general concept AI refers to a computer applying human intellectual characteristics to problem solve, namely the ability to reason, make generalizations, and to learn from previous experiences. [1] , [2] AI is an applicable term across numerous technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, rule-based expert systems, physical robots, and robotic process automation. [3] In healthcare, AI is currently applied in diagnostics, population health management, patient engagement, patient adherence promotion, and in administrative activities. 3 However, the focus of this Perspective is on the use of AI in healthcare diagnostics, specifically imaging.\nMedical imaging is one of the most promising areas for the application and innovative use of AI. The use of AI in radiology has the potential to improve the efficiency and efficacy of medical imaging. Its use may also alleviate some of the burden and burnout experienced by radiologists who feel overwhelmed by the proliferation in the volume of imaging studies performed and unable to devote sufficient time to providing meaningful, patient-centric care.\nUse of AI in diagnostic imaging can be included in processes such as acquiring the image, processing the image, interpreting the findings, determining follow-up care, and selecting appropriate data storage. 2 When conducting an imaging study, the use of AI can improve the quality of the image captured. AI systems can detect at the time of imaging whether the quality of the data acquired is optimal for analysis and then alert radiologists, should additional scans be necessary. Automated protocols can also ensure that no necessary components of the scan are overlooked by the providers during its examination and that all required images are captured. [4] Further, AI systems can learn the features of a high-quality image, apply computational strategies to increase the odds of producing that image, and automatically compensate for any distortions.4 , [5] , [6] As a result, AI use during image capture can optimize staffing, reduce scanner time, and decrease radiation dosing for the patient. 2\nOnce the image has been captured, AI can support imaging analysis. Approaches utilizing AI for imaging analysis have been an area of rapid growth. 3 AI algorithms look at images to identify patterns and then use pattern recognition to identify abnormalities. That may include flagging apparent abnormal findings or actually identifying masses and fractures. 2,3 AI may be particularly beneficial when using imaging devices that produce a high number of images for each study conducted, such as MRIs. An electronic system can efficiently review significantly more images than would be feasible for an individual provider. AI can then support the diagnosis and treatment decision-making process by facilitating the integration of the imaging results within the patient electronic medical record. Once incorporated, the image can then be used alongside patient clinical data and medical history in computer-aided diagnosis. In some instances, AI may even predict which treatment protocols are most likely to be successful. 3\nOnce the imaging study has been conducted, AI systems can help ensure continuity in provider communication and patient care. For example, AI can review patient records to ensure that an imaging diagnosis is correlated with the radiological reports and that there is an associated treatment plan. 4 Providers can then be alerted to any discrepancies. This can ensure that findings from radiological reports are addressed expeditiously and avoid unnecessary patient return visits.\nAs the technology supporting AI and the sophistication of its applications continues to advance, the role AI plays in imaging diagnostics will likely expand. For example, with improvements in image analysis, systems may be used to autonomously triage patients for review by a radiologist. [7] Additionally, as predictive algorithms become more advanced and adaptive, the role of AI in the review of both pathology and radiology images will grow. 3 AI can also be expected to play a more direct role in the recommendation of treatment protocols.\nAI in imaging has already demonstrated a great deal of potential and opportunity to improve patient safety through enhancing imaging processes, aiding physician diagnosis, and minimizing discrepancies. However, there are several ethical concerns directly related to patient safety that must be addressed as the use of AI becomes more pervasive and plays a greater role in patient diagnosis. The first is in the evaluation of the AI technology and determining what level of accuracy is required, and conversely the percentage of misses that are acceptable, to substitute review and decision making by a human. Establishing a standardized benchmark for what constitutes \u201cgood enough\u201d in AI products may be beneficial both for approval processes by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and also for guiding its use in facilities.\nThis first consideration directly leads into the second question of accountability. Should the use of AI directly or indirectly lead to misdiagnosis and improper treatment recommendations, who is (and who should be) held at fault? Similarly, should a physician opt not to use available AI and the patient is misdiagnosed, is the physician accountable for that decision? In either instance, is it possible to prove that using or not using AI would have ended in a different result for the patient?\nFinally, while AI is intended to reduce diagnostic errors, there is the risk that the use of AI can introduce new potential errors. New potential errors have been detailed in a 2019 analysis by Challen et al . One example notes the potential for error resulting from discrepancies between the data used to train AI systems and the real-world clinical scenario due to limited availability of high-quality training data. AI systems are not as equipped as humans to recognize when there is a relevant change in context or data that can impact the validity of learned predictive assumptions. Therefore, AI systems may unknowingly apply programmed methodology for assessment inappropriately, resulting in error. Another example includes an insensitivity to potential impact. AI systems may not be trained in the same ways as humans to \u2018err on the side of caution\u2019. While that can result in more false positives, this approach may be appropriate when the alternative is a serious safety outcome for the patient. 7\nDespite the potential of AI in diagnostic imaging, in the short term it is most likely to complement rather than replace traditional approaches used by radiologists. With many unanswered questions associated with the use of AI and concerns regarding the introduction of new patient safety risks, AI will continue to serve as an adjunct rather than an alternative to a radiologist. However, appropriate incorporation of AI has the potential to alleviate some of the workflow burden experienced by radiologists and allow them to spend more time on other aspects of their role in caring for the patient. This includes providing emotional support and guidance, implementing interventional procedures, and participating in multidisciplinary clinical team patient safety initiatives. 2\nKendall K.

        "https://sma.org/ai-in-medical-diagnosis/": "October 7, 2021 // Randy Glick\nThe use of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is growing rapidly in the medical field, especially in diagnostics and management of treatment. To date there has been a wide range of research into how AI can aid clinical decisions and enhance physicians' judgement.\nAccurate diagnosis is a fundamental aspect of global healthcare systems. In the US, approximately 5% of outpatients receive an incorrect diagnosis, with errors being particularly common for serious medical conditions, and carrying the risk of serious patient harm.\nIn recent years, AI and machine learning have emerged as powerful tools for assisting diagnosis. This technology could revolutionise healthcare by providing more precise diagnoses.\nLast year, scientists at Babylon, a global tech company focusing on digital health, found a new way to use machine learning to diagnose disease. They developed new AI symptom checkers which they believe could help reduce diagnostic mistakes in primary care.\nThe new approach overcomes the limitations of earlier versions by using causal reasoning in its machine learning. Previously, diagnoses were based solely on correlations between symptoms and the most likely cause.\nWriting in Nature Communications, Dr Jonathan Richens and colleagues outlined their new approach, which includes the ability to \u201cimagine\u201d the possibility of a patient\u2019s symptoms being due to a range of different conditions.\nDr Richens explained, \"We took artificial intelligence with a powerful algorithm, and gave it the ability to imagine alternate realities and consider 'would this symptom be present if it was a different disease'? This allows the artificial intelligence to tease apart the potential causes of a patient's illness and score more highly than over 70% of the doctors on these written test cases.\"\nThis method could provide diagnoses in regions where access to doctors is limited, according to Dr Ali Parsa, CEO of Babylon. He commented, \"Half the world has almost no access to healthcare. So it's exciting to see these promising results in test cases. This should not be sensationalised as machines replacing doctors, because what is truly encouraging here is for us to finally get tools that allow us to increase the reach and productivity of our existing healthcare systems.\n\u201cArtificial intelligence will be an important tool to help us all end the injustice in the uneven distribution of healthcare, and to make it more accessible and affordable for every person on Earth.\"\nAnother group of scientists, from the University of Bonn, Germany, have found a technique using AI that can improve the diagnosis of leukaemia from blood samples. They developed a machine learning programme based on evaluating blood or bone marrow for the presence of cancer of the lymphatic system.\nDr Peter Krawitz and colleagues say the method improves a number of measurement values and \"increases the speed as well as the objectivity of the analyses, compared to established processes\". The freely accessible machine learning method can now be used by small laboratories with reduced resources, they report.\nDr Krawitz explained that sample analysis using flow cytometry is very time-consuming. \"With 20 markers, the doctor would already have to compare about 150 two-dimensional images,\" he said, \"that's why it's usually too costly to thoroughly sift through the entire data set.\"\nThe team explored how AI could be used to carry out flow cytometry testing. They trained their AI programme with information from over 30,000 data sets from patients with B-cell lymphoma. Full details were published recently in the journal Patterns.\nCo-author Dr Nanditha Mallesh said, \"AI takes full advantage of the data and increases the speed and objectivity of diagnoses. The result of the AI evaluations is a suggested diagnosis that still needs to be verified by the physician.\"\nDr Krawitz added, \"The gold standard is diagnosis by haematologists, which can also take into account results of additional tests. The point of using AI is not to replace physicians, but to make the best use of the information contained in the data.\"\nThe team point out that, in contrast to classical diagnostic methods based on interpretation of results by human experts, AI and machine learning-based approaches have the potential for low cost per sample, once the system is trained.\nFor example, they analyzed over 12,000 samples from more than 100 individual studies to show that combining machine learning and gene expression profiling can \"yield highly effective and robust diagnostic classifiers\". Such classifiers could, in the future, potentially assist in primary diagnosis of this disease particularly in settings where hematological expertise is not sufficiently available or too costly.\nFurthermore, they believe that similar analyses may be useful for other diseases when analyzing whole blood or gene expression profiles, or for multiple conditions in parallel. This would allow diagnosis of several conditions at essentially the same marginal cost per additional sample. Such approaches could lead to large efficiency gains in the future.\nIn the UK, researchers at Queen Mary University of London have found a way to use AI to analyse blood from rheumatoid arthritis patients and predict their response to treatment in advance.\nThis involved the identification of new biomarkers that serve as indicators of the effectiveness of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, which do not benefit around half of patients. Levels of certain small molecules involved in regulating inflammation could predict the body\u2019s ability to benefit from these drugs.\nAI analysis of blood samples highlighted those who would be responsive to treatment and those who would not. Details were published in Nature Communications. Lead author, Professor Jesmond Dallifrom, said, \u201cCurrently a large proportion of patients are unresponsive to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and are therefore unnecessarily exposed to their side effects.\n\u201cIn addition, it can currently take up to six months from treatment initiation to determine whether someone will or will not respond to these medicines. For the patients who do not respond to the treatment, the disease gets worse before they are able to find a treatment that is more likely to work for them.\u201d\nThe team are now beginning a larger study to check whether their findings are widely applicable to rheumatoid arthritis patients.\nA separate UK-based team have developed machine learning technology that can spot several of the underlying red flags for a future heart attack. Professor Charalambos Antoniades at the University of Oxford, and colleagues created a new biomarker which they call the 'fat radiomic profile'.\nIt was discovered using machine learning to detect biological red flags in the perivascular space lining blood vessels which supply blood to the heart. Details appeared in the European Heart Journal, where the authors explain that it identifies inflammation, scarring and changes to these blood vessels.\nThe team hopes this will be a significant improvement on the current approach when a patient arrives at hospital with chest pain. The new method was developed after testing fat biopsies from 167 people undergoing cardiac surgery, to analyse the expression of genes associated with inflammation, scarring and new blood vessel formation.\nProfessor Antoniades said, \u201cJust because someone\u2019s scan of their coronary artery shows there\u2019s no narrowing, that does not mean they are safe from a heart attack. By harnessing the power of AI, we\u2019ve developed a fingerprint to find \u2018bad\u2019 characteristics around people\u2019s arteries. This has huge potential to detect the early signs of disease, and to be able to take all preventative steps before a heart attack strikes, ultimately saving lives.\u201d\nA research team in India, led by Dr Vathsala Patil of the Manipal Academy of Higher Education in Karnataka, looked at the potential of AI to improve the work of radiologists. In a recent journal article they write, \"Evolution in hardware and software application has led to an escalating number of tasks performed by machines that were initially unimaginable. The most noteworthy tool has been the introduction of learning algorithms. Tasks can now be performed, which were previously limited to humans, thus indicating that these algorithms have significantly improved recently.\"\nThey highlight the potential for deep learning algorithms, which they describe as \"comparatively less challenging to train\" and \"able to outdo the performance of other AI approaches and medical experts in specific tasks such as recognizing pneumonia on imaging scans\".\n\"The acquired information can be used throughout the clinical care path to improve diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as assess the potential and subsequent response to treatment,\" they write.\nHowever, despite these and many more significant research efforts, algorithms have struggled to achieve the overall diagnostic accuracy of doctors. Future studies should continue to determine the effectiveness of AI algorithms as a clinical support system for diagnosis, guiding doctors by providing a second opinion.\nIt may be that combining whole-genome and a range of other patient data for use by machine learning algorithms will ultimately allow early detection, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, subclassification, and outcome prediction in an integrated fashion.\nAs Dr Jonathan Richens and colleagues at Babylon conclude, \"It is likely that the combined diagnosis of doctor and algorithm will be more accurate than either alone.\"\nReferences and Resources\n- Richens, J. et al.

        "https://www.aidoc.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-medical-diagnosis/": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become synonymous with support and efficiency in the medical community. From a technology viewed with suspicion as claims touted it the replacement for the medical professional, AI has evolved to become the second pair of eyes that never need to sleep. Artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis and healthcare provides overworked medical practitioners and facilities with reliable support, helping to minimize workload pressure while maximizing practitioner efficiency.\nArtificial intelligence in medical diagnosis helps with medical decision making, management, automation, admin, and workflows. It can be used to diagnose cancer, triage critical findings in medical imaging, flag acute abnormalities, provide radiologists with help in prioritizing life threatening cases, diagnose cardiac arrhythmias, predict stroke outcomes , and help with the management of chronic diseases. AI is a rich realm of data, algorithms, analytics, deep learning, neural networks and insights that\u2019s constantly growing and adapting to the needs of the healthcare industry and its patients. Over the past few years, artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis has shown immense promise in changing the standards of medical care while reducing the extreme pressures felt by the medical industry.\nPhysician burnout is a very real problem . The exhaustion and overwork felt by many medical professionals is impacting on their performance. Physicians are leaving their jobs, struggling to deliver quality patient care, and juggling complex emotional challenges. This is largely brought on by long hours, overwhelming workloads and a lack of support. Physicians make complex and life changing decisions, daily, and often are not given either the space or time to manage their workloads effectively. In the recent Medscape National Physician Burnout and Suicide Report 2022 , the statistics pointed to the risks inherent in putting too much pressure on practitioners, especially those trying to juggle families, retirement planning and the complexities of their jobs.\nIn this year\u2019s report, 47% of physicians revealed that they\u2019re burned out. The specialties most affected being emergency medicine, critical care, family medicine, neurology, urology, and internal medicine. The leading cause? The administrative burden.\nThis is where AI can play a pivotal role. Designed with intent, artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis can not only reduce the pressure on physicians when working through vast quantities of information and imaging, but it can be used to undertake a large percentage of the administrative burden. The right solutions, developed specifically for the healthcare sector, can be used to provide medical practitioners with essential support as they manage increasing volumes of data, information and imaging volumes.\nAI can provide tangible support to overworked physicians with systems that are designed to minimize stress and increase time spent with patients.\nArtificial intelligence in medical diagnosis is a powerful tool for reducing physician burnout, but equally for providing the radiology professional with exceptional support in managing workloads that are only on the increase. Radiologists have to deal with multiple and rising imaging volumes, and they\u2019re expected to do so at speeds that were previously unheard of. Today, they have to sift through volumes of images while still prioritizing those that are urgent and managing patient care.\nThis is where artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis really shines. AI and deep learning solutions have been providing radiologists with essential support as they manage these weighty imaging volumes, offering them the ability to streamline workflows, save time, increase capacity and increase diagnosis reliability. This reduces pressure on the radiologist significantly. Solutions such as Aidoc go through the vast quantities of images, flagging those that the AI consider to be of concern. The radiologist can then assess the flagged images as a matter of priority, thereby catching urgent cases faster without compromising on their existing workloads or cases.\nAidoc has obtained 13 FDA/CE clearances for the flagging and prioritization of acute abnormalities in CT scans and is already deployed and showing value at over 1000 medical facilities across the world.\nArtificial intelligence in medical diagnosis is still on the edge of its potential. There\u2019s plenty of room for growth and for the technology to improve on what it can do to support the medical profession. AI as it stands today is already being integrated into practice and workflows, and as it continues to evolve and change and adapt, it will likely step up to give the medical profession a reliable set of tools that can aid in diagnosis, workflow, admin and workload.",
