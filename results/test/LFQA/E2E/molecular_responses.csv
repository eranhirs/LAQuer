"1. The SUBJECT of the CLAIM is ""Reparations"".
2. The CONTEXT repeatedly and explicitly details that ""Reparations"" refers to compensations given for abuses or injuries, distinguishing it from ""punishment"" which is associated with retribution.

"1. The SUBJECT ""They"" refers to ""Reparations"".
2. The CONTEXT provides a detailed explanation regarding the nature and purpose of reparations, indicating that they are understood as compensation. The introduction of the SUBJECT in the CONTEXT emphasizes its role and purpose directly in dealing with human rights violations and injustices. Therefore, the decontextualization should incorporate this aspect to resolve ambiguity.

"1. The CLAIM does not specify the SUBJECT since it begins with ""are victims,"" which implies the need to elucidate who the victims are.
2. The CONTEXT primarily discusses the concept of reparations and its purpose to address the needs of ""victims of severe human rights violations.""
3. Since the discussion revolves around the broader concept of reparations without introducing any specific individuals or groups, the reference to ""victims of severe human rights violations"" is best interpreted as a general reference to those affected by such abuses.
4. Therefore, the SUBJECT can be generalized as ""Victims of severe human rights violations,"" and the CLAIM can be adjusted to utilize the CONTEXT's focus on this group.

2. The CONTEXT provides information about Reparations, focusing mainly on their purpose. The description of Reparations in the CONTEXT highlights that they are intended to address victims' needs, distinguishing them from other forms of justice. The introduction in the CONTEXT does not emphasize any particular criterion (such as time period or location), so the focus remains on their purpose.

2. The CONTEXT explains that reparations are understood as compensation for abuse or injury, including various measures like compensation, restitution, and other forms of acknowledgment and redress.
