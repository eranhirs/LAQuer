These programs recommended reparations for the victims, including: monthly pensions, educational benefits for the children of the disappeared, exemption from military service, and priority access to health services. However, these initiatives have also been criticized on a variety of grounds, such as their refusal to identify the perpetrators of violence and their failure to recognize a comprehensive range of victims to whom reparations are due. Morocco \u2013 In Morocco , the period between the 1960s and 1990s is often referred to as the \"years of lead,\" referring to the massive human rights violations that occurred in the government's campaign of political oppression, including executions, torture, and the annihilation of other civil liberties. Shortly after he ascended the throne in 1999, King Mohammed VI created the Independent Arbitration Commission (IAC) to compensate the victims of forced disappearances and arbitrary detention. The IAC decided more than 5,000 cases and awarded a total of US$100 million, but victims and their families complained of lack of transparency in the tribunal's procedures and demanded truth seeking measures in addition to financial compensation. These pressures were instrumental in leading to the 2004 creation of the Arab world's first official truth-seeking initiative, the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. The IER issued a reparations policy that upheld notions of gender equity and resulted in roughly US$85 million in financial compensation paid to almost 10,000 individuals, as well as recommendations on other measures such as the provision of health care and restoration of civil rights. The IER's recommendations also led to a collective reparations program that combined symbolic recognition of human rights violations with a development component in eleven regions that had suffered from collective punishment. [19] As of May 2010, implementation of the collective reparations program was ongoing. Other reparations programs have been proposed and/or implemented in: Argentina, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, East Timor, El Salvador, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Iraq, Malawi, Liberia, South Africa, Kenya, the United States, and others. [2] [20] A dignity taking is the destruction or confiscation of property rights from owners or occupiers, where the intentional or unintentional outcome is dehumanization or infantilization. [21] There are two requirements: (1) involuntary property destruction or confiscation and (2) dehumanization or infantilization. [22] Dehumanization is \u201cthe failure to recognize an individual or group\u2019s humanity\u201d and infantilization is \u201cthe restriction of an individual or group\u2019s autonomy based on the failure to recognize and respect their full capacity to reason.\u201d [21] Evidence of a dignity taking can be established empirically through either a top-down approach, examining the motive and intent behind those who initiated the taking, or a bottom-up approach, examining the viewpoints of dispossessed people. [22] When this larger harm called a dignity taking occurs, mere reparations (or compensation for physical things taken) are not enough. [21] Dignity restoration is required. [22] Dignity restoration is a remedy that seeks to provide dispossessed individuals and communities with material compensation through processes that affirm their humanity and reinforce their agency. [21] In practical terms, the remedial process places dispossessed individuals or communities in the driver\u2019s seat and gives them a significant degree of autonomy in deciding how they are made whole. [22] The dignity takings/dignity restoration framework was first created by Professor Bernadette Atuahene following her empirical exploration of land dispossession and restitution in South Africa in her book, We Want What\u2019s Ours: Learning from South Africa\u2019s Restitution Program (Oxford University Press 2014). [23] Since then, many scholars across disciplines have applied these socio-legal concepts to an array of case studies in various time periods and geographic locations, providing a transnational, historicized approach to understanding involuntary property loss and its material and non-material consequences. [24] The dignity takings/dignity restoration framework provides a lexicon to describe and analyze property takings from poor and vulnerable populations across the globe in different historical periods; focuses on redress by linking events of property dispossession to highlight opportunities for learning, resistance, and solidarity; allows people who are not property scholars to participate in the conversation about involuntary property loss and adequate remedies; captures both the material and immaterial consequences of property confiscation; and inserts dignity into the scholarly discourse about property, countering the singular focus on efficiency, which has dominated legal analysis since the ascendancy of law and economics. [25] There are logistical problems inherent in reparations, such as clearly defining the objectives, goals, and processes by which reparations will be distributed, determining how to address a range of atrocities with streamlined programs, or balancing economic development with financing reparation efforts. [26] Some experts suggest that the problems lie in the very definition of reparations themselves. [27] The right to seek and obtain reparations is vested with the state whose citizens suffered the losses, but individuals are barred from pursuing a claim for compensation directly against the state that wronged them. The grant of reparations is thus a political question, and individuals who suffered harm may be left undercompensated or uncompensated. [28] The UN's guidelines on reparations could be contested on the fact that they equate human rights violations with violations of civil and political rights, ignoring abuses of economic, social, and cultural rights. The guidelines explicitly state that their intent is to restore victims to their status in a time of peace, but the distribution of rights and resources often wasn't equal in peacetime. Thus reparations, if their intent is to return a society to its status quo , run the risk of ignoring systemic oppression and reproducing social hierarchies. [2] For instance, reparations programs have been critiqued for ignoring the needs of women in transitional justice processes. In 2007, women's groups mobilized to examine how reparations policies could be more responsive to victims of gender-based violence. Their efforts led to the \"Nairobi Declaration on Women's and Girl's Right to a Remedy and Reparation,\" which states that \"reparations must go above and beyond the immediate reasons and consequences of the crimes and violations; they must aim to address the political and structural inequalities that negatively shape women's and girl's lives.\" [29] Some of these concerns can be addressed by empowering women to have a voice in the reparations process, challenging discriminatory practices, and educating communities about sexual violence. [16] In addition to gender-based discrimination, children are often excluded from reparations procedures. The reasons of this are varied; reparations often fall in the hands of parents and are only indirectly given to children, and reparations programs often do not take into account the fact that children and adults are affected differently by violence. Thus reparations should also have a child-specific component to target abuses that are specifically suffered by children.

While some advocates for restorative justice argue that punitive tactics like reparations have no place in this method, reparations can serve as a bridge to healing the damage to the community and victims.

An offender is approached first to ensure that he/she will cooperate in apologizing and expressing remorse before asking anything of the victim (Sherman & Strang, 2007).\nAnother argument in favor of restorative justice is that it produces results; in other words, it stops certain offenders from committing crimes again. Punitive measures may or may not have a deterrent effect. For instance, there is no difference in deterrence for crimes that bring about the death penalty versus life in prison (Banks, 2013). Some criminologists argue that the criminal justice system has a deterrent effect; others state that \u201cthe criminal may well fear the law but still break it\u201d and professional criminals do not experience the same shock at getting caught (Banks, 2013, p. 119). To truly prevent future crimes, then, we must employ more than fear. Banks points out a perspective that law-abiding citizens act within the law not out of fear but because of \u201cmoral inhibitions and norms of conduct\u201d (p. 119). Restorative justice can aim to change these norms of conduct for an offender. Through proper treatment programs and personal management strategies, as well as a supportive community instituting these norms, an offender\u2019s moral mindset may be influenced. This idea draws upon Sutherland\u2019s theory of differential association, which posits that our interaction with others teaches us values, attitudes, and motives.

How do we define punishment? What are the end goals and purpose? What values should it promote? These questions reach a broad scope of opinion, depending on who is asked. Regardless, restorative justice fits into the theoretical framework of punishment. \u200bPunishment should first and foremost serve the function of protecting society. This can be done by incapacitating those who cannot be rehabilitated, and restoring those who can into productive, beneficial citizens. Restorative justice is built on the belief that a supportive community can transform negative behaviors. Restorative justice aims to heal victims, offenders, and the community. For victims, this may involve restoring property, healing injuries, and bringing back \u201ca sense of security\u201d (Banks, 2013, p. 128). Victims are involved in the justice process and given a voice; they are encouraged to tell their story and have the offender and/or community respond with empathy. On the other end, offenders are supported and controlled by social management, rather than a punitive, detached system. This means they are given the tools and resources to restore their bonds with the community and make better choices. To accomplish this, the community must stretch beyond stigmatizing criminality and adopt a supportive mentality for the victim and offender. True restorative justice occurs with all three entities: victim, offender, and community. While restorative justice is not a \u201cpunishment\u201d in the traditional sense, the way incapacitation or the death sentence is, it falls under this category because, based on Banks\u2019 descriptions, it 1) involves the community showing disapproval (in that an offender must accept responsibility); 2) allows offenders to make amends for the harm they have caused; and 3) will stop offenders from committing crimes again (2013). Where does restorative justice fit into the justice system? First, one must acknowledge the role of incapacitation and retribution. Some sociopathic tendencies cannot be treated or amended, the crimes so heinous that there are no solutions but incapacitation and retribution. These forms of punishment are important because there is no other leverage in the criminal justice system for protecting against individuals who sincerely do not care about society, law and order, rehabilitation, or the value of life itself. They feel no remorse, so the punishment should treat them with the same indifference. In other words, retribution is a \u201cfight fire with fire\u201d technique; it is concerned with justice and justice alone. Such is the case with someone like the notorious Ted Bundy, who murdered an estimated forty victims, believed killing was a divine experience, and never admitted remorse. He received the death penalty for his crimes, which, given the number of lives he mercilessly took, was the only fitting punishment that didn't violate the constitution... In the average case, however, the trouble with judging whether someone is capable of rehabilitation or restoration is that remorse is not always easy to discern, especially not in a court setting. There are conflicting ideas of what constitutes an indicator of \u201cgenuine\u201d remorse, which makes such a judgment call so subjective (Zong, 2014). Aside from the extremes, which do not currently make up the majority of our prison population, punishment should be reparative, designed to amend wrongs and prevent further harms to society. These concepts flourish with restorative justice. There are also aspects of retribution in restorative justice (Banks, 2013). An offender may be ordered to pay reparations to a victim or victim\u2019s family or complete community service. While some advocates for restorative justice argue that punitive tactics like reparations have no place in this method, reparations can serve as a bridge to healing the damage to the community and victims. It might go toward repairing a broken window, replacing a stolen item, helping to rebuild a burnt house, assist with a victim\u2019s medical bills, and so on. This goes toward allowing offenders to make amends. Opponents to restorative justice argue that victims might feel the crimes they suffered are taken less seriously than those that result in a prison sentence, and it may suggest that \u201csociety has a different attitude toward certain kinds of behavior\u201d (Banks, 2013, p. 129).
