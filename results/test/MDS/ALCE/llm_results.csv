test34,9,0.txt,"[(133, 1941)]","Kavanaugh is appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday as senators continue publicly interviewing President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh, a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has a good chance of being confirmed when the Senate votes later this month. Under questioning from senators, he has so far touched on Roe v. Wade, said courts - not the president - are ""the final word"" and, as the hearing began, watched drama unfold regarding Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.)'s pledge to release confidential documents.
Key moments from the hearing:
  Drama over confidential emails....that were already cleared for public release
  Kavanaugh advised against calling Roe ""settled law""
  Kavanaugh elaborates on dissent on contraception and religious objections
  Emails show more involvement with nominee than Kavanaugh previously suggested
10:13 p.m.: Hearing adjourned
More than 12 hours after the questioning began Thursday morning, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) adjourned the confirmation hearing for the day. Grassley closed the session by praising Kavanaugh for his ""compelling and credible"" answers, highlighted his history on the bench and said that ""unquestionably, you're qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.""
""I hope a lot of people in this country have formed very positive views of you, as I have,"" Grassley said.
Kavanaugh spent nearly 24 hours over two days answering questions, with many of the discussions on Thursday centering in some way or another on President Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh to the high court.
